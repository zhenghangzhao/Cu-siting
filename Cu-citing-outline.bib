abstract = {The relationships among the macroscopic compositional parameters of a Cu-exchanged SSZ-13 zeolite catalyst, the types and numbers of Cu active sites, and activity for the selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NOx with NH3 are established through experimental interrogation and computational analysis of materials across the catalyst composition space. Density functional theory, stochastic models, and experimental characterizations demonstrate that within the synthesis protocols applied here and across Si:Al ratios, the volumetric density of six-membered-rings (6MR) containing two Al (2Al sites) is consistent with a random Al siting in the SSZ-13 lattice subject to L{\"{o}}wenstein's rule. Further, exchanged CuII ions first populate these 2Al sites before populating remaining unpaired, or 1Al, sites as CuIIOH. These sites are distinguished and enumerated ex situ through vibrational and X-ray absorption spectroscopies (XAS) and chemical titrations. In situ and operando XAS follow Cu oxidation state and coordinatio...},

abstract = {Copper-exchanged, small-pore chabazite (CHA) zeolites were commercialized in 2009 for the selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NOx compounds with ammonia, as an emissions control strategy in diesel automotive exhaust aftertreatment. Here, we review the fundamental scientific advances that have since been made in the molecular-level understanding of the active sites and mechanisms responsible for NOx SCR with NH3 on Cu-CHA catalysts. A large body of experimental and theoretical characterization has identified that these “single-site” catalysts contain Cu sites of different local coordinations and structures, influenced by synthetic and environmental factors. The speciation of isolated Cu ions is inextricably linked to the support composition and the conditions of exposure. We make new and unifying connections among the seemingly disparate findings of experimental investigations of Cu-CHA catalysts that differ in origin and treatment history, using ex situ and in situ characterizations, and operando characterization during catalysis. We discuss theory-based studies, in conjunction with multiple experimental spectroscopic methods performed on model Cu-CHA catalysts, that provide precise molecular assignments across a wide range of catalysts and conditions. We highlight how molecular-level descriptions of the active sites and mechanisms can provide insight into the chemical factors that influence practical SCR performance and behavior, including the onset of low-temperature NOx conversion, and the critical role of NH3 solvation of Cu active sites for low-temperature activity. Finally, we describe how the fundamental heterogeneous catalysis science approaches used to interrogate Cu-CHA catalysts used for NOx SCR with NH3 can be used to elucidate the molecular-level details of chemistry that occurs on other single-site catalysts.},

abstract = {Theory and experiment reveal relationships between observed UV-visible spectra and ion exchange site types, ion nuclearity, and finite-temperature dynamics in Cu exchanged chabazite (SSZ-13) zeolites. The speciation and structure of Cu ions and complexes in chabazite (SSZ-13) zeolites, which are relevant catalysts for nitrogen oxide reduction and partial methane oxidation, depend on material composition and reaction environment. Ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectra of Cu-SSZ-13 zeolites synthesized to contain specific Cu site motifs, together with ab initio molecular dynamics and time-dependent density functional theory calculations, were used to test the ability to relate specific spectroscopic signatures to specific site motifs. Geometrically distinct arrangements of two framework Al atoms in six-membered rings are found to exchange Cu 2+ ions that become spectroscopically indistinguishable after accounting for the finite-temperature fluctuations of the Cu coordination environment. Nominally homogeneous single Al exchange sites are found to exchange a heterogeneous mixture of [CuOH] + monomers, O- and OH-bridged Cu dimers, and larger polynuclear complexes. The UV-Vis spectra of the latter are sensitive to framework Al proximity, to precise ligand environment, and to finite-temperature structural fluctuations, precluding the precise assignment of spectroscopic features to specific Cu structures. In all Cu-SSZ-13 samples, these dimers and larger complexes are reduced by CO to Cu + sites at 523 K, leaving behind isolated [CuOH] + sites with a characteristic spectroscopic identity. The various mononuclear and polynuclear Cu 2+ species are distinguishable by their different responses to reducing environments, with implications for their relevance to catalytic redox reactions. },

abstract = {Operando X-ray absorption experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations are reported that elucidate the role of copper redox chemistry in the selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NO over Cu-exchanged SSZ-13. Catalysts prepared to contain only isolated, exchanged Cu(II) ions evidence both Cu(II) and Cu(I) ions under standard SCR conditions at 473 K. Reactant cutoff experiments show that NO and NH3 together are necessary for Cu(II) reduction to Cu(I). DFT calculations show that NO-assisted NH3 dissociation is both energetically favorable and accounts for the observed Cu(II) reduction. The calculations predict in situ generation of Br{\o}nsted sites proximal to Cu(I) upon reduction, which we quantify in separate titration experiments. Both NO and O2 are necessary for oxidation of Cu(I) to Cu(II), which DFT suggests to occur by a NO2 intermediate. Reaction of Cu-bound NO2 with proximal NH4(+) completes the catalytic cycle. N2 is produced in both reduction and oxidation half-cycles.},
